    <h3>RECENT years have seen a disturbing rise in the extrajudicial killings of blasphemy suspects — <br />sometimes in police custody. Such cases reveal the increasing complicity of law-enforcement officials in the perpetuation of religious extremism, often under the influence of radical elements in society.</h3>
<p>Although cases of suspected blasphemy are supposed to go through a legal process, police officers have increasingly become enablers or direct participants in extrajudicial actions.</p>

   <p> A case last month exemplified this trend when Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a Muslim doctor from Sindh, was killed over blasphemy allegations. It was the second such killing within a week, following the murder of Abdul Ali in Quetta on Sept 12, 2024.
    <p>Police initially claimed that Kunbhar was killed during a shootout after allegedly opening fire at a checkpoint. However, when human rights groups raised questions about the police account, the official story changed. The authorities then claimed that Kunbhar had been shot by his colleague, who later fled. Local media, however, reported that the police had arrested Kunbhar and killed him in a staged encounter in Mirpurkhas.</p>
    A video then surfaced showing the DIG in charge of the area, who reportedly oversaw the operation, being garlanded by religious leaders. This public celebration of an extrajudicial killing by senior law-enforcement officials highlights the deep-rooted extremism in the police force. Rights groups are outraged. Attorney Lazar Allahrakha stated: “When police officers start acting like vigilantes, there’s no hope left for justice.”
    Several factors have contributed to the rise of extremism within Pakistan’s police force.</p>

   <p> Abdul Ali’s killing in Quetta also exemplifies this trend. Ali had been arrested after a mob accused him of blasphemy, but despite being rescued from mob violence, he was killed by a police officer while in custody. Though the officer was arrested, the family of the suspect pardoned him, reflecting how deeply entrenched religious extremism is within our social and legal structures. These incidents show how the police, instead of protecting accused individuals from violence, have assumed the role of judge, jury, and executioner — receiving public praise for their actions.
    Earlier incidents such as the lynching of Muhammad Waris in February 2023 also underscore the perilous environment for blasphemy suspects in police custody. Waris was beaten to death by a mob that stormed a police station in Nankana Sahib, despite his detention under police protection. Similarly, a Christian man accused of desecration was killed by a mob while in police custody in Karachi. The police either failed to protect the suspects or were complicit in their deaths, further illustrating the breakdown of law enforcement in the face of extremist pressure.
    Several factors have contributed to the rise of extremism within Pakistan’s police. A primary reason is the radicalisation of society, which has deeply influenced state institutions, including law enforcement. Officers are often pressured by extremist groups, and some share the same ideological beliefs as the mobs they are supposed to control. These dynamics make it difficult for the officials to remain impartial or protect the accused.
